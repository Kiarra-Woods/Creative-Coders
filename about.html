    <b><p>The Art Club first started in September of 2016. These group members are a prime component of what we know as the JCM-ECH Art Club. Some members, that are of the current sophomore class, will also be attending the very first graduation from Early College High School in 2019. Now that's an honor!!</p>
    <p>The club is currently working on a project in Officer Young's office. It consists of many paintings of cougars, the American flag and a Sheriff badge.</p>
    <p>In the future they will be painting our assistant principal's office along with the school principal's office.</p>
    <p>Although these students have not known each other for years, they work hard and cooperate together like family. They are a group of hard working students and love creating things when they have the chance. The Art Club is certainly welcoming of others and support each other and their very similiar dreams. Every member of this group is an example of what a JCM-ECH student should look like.</p></b>
