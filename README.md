# Creative-Coders

Our website is for the JCM-ECH Art Club that gives our school, Early College High, more creativity.  There are not photos of all the members on the website and in place of them are drawings that I, Kiarra Woods, have done of them for the time being. I could also not get all the photos of drawings/paintings that all the members have done, but I did get enough to fill the page to show what the members can do.  -Kiarra Woods



I hope that I am able to add the secret link onto our website. If I am successful it will be on the last page. The link will go to a picture and a paragraph thanking everyone for this opportunity.  -Zadarius Norment
